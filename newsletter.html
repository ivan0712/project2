        <p> <h2> What is Covid-19?</h2></p>
        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the infectious disease known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and 
            recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
             medical attention.</p>

        <p>If you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but you’re contagious during this time. Ten days following the onset of your symptoms, you are no longer contagious.

      <h4 class="heading-3">How does Covid-19 spread?</h4>
      <p>According to recent research, the virus mainly spreads between two persons who are in direct contact to one another, as when they are conversing. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes, the virus can spread from their mouth or nose in a tiny liquid particles. The virus can then be spread to another person through short-range aerosol transmission or by direct contact of infectious particles with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Additionally, the virus can spread in overcrowded areas and poorly ventilated indoor areas where people frequently spend longer periods of time.

      <h4 class="heading-3">The greatest strategy to stop others from catching COVID-19 is to:</h4>
      <p>Aim to keep your distance of 6 feet from other people.
When around people, put on a cotton mask that covers your mouth and nose.
Regularly wash your hands. Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if washing is not an option.
Do not enter busy indoor areas. Open windows to let in as much fresh air as you can.
If you are experiencing symptoms that could be COVID-19 or if a COVID-19 test results in a positive result, isolate yourself at home.
Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected.

      <h4 class="heading-4">After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:</h4>
      <p>While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
         Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.
         Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
         Clean your hands frequently.
         Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
         Keep the room well-ventilated.
         If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.
         Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.
         Call your health care provider immediately if you have any of these danger signs: difficulty breathing, loss of speech or mobility, confusion or chest pain.
